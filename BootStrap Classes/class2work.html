    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">React Native lets you create truly native apps and doesn't compromise your users' experiences. It provides a core set of platform agnostic native components like <code>View</code>, <code>Text</code>, and <code>Image</code> that map directly to the platform's native UI building blocks.</p>
